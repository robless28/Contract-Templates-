# Contract-Templates-
This is the three (3) templates that we have for the Owlery Management application for our Senior Project 

# BEST VERSION 
TOO MANY BEST VERSIONS BUT THE ONE OF 10/17/25 @ 4 PM IS THE BEST FS

# whats been done
- created the template for the real estate contract (real_estate_contract.html) 
- created the template for the lease contract (lease_contract.html)
- created the template for the mortgage contract (mortgage_contract.html)

- made the index be in the right place so it launches directly with the created "Home Page"     
    that says the text "Welcome to Contract Generator
                Select a contract type and generate your legal document instantly.
                            Go to Contract Generator"


# pages 
index.html - this is the home page (so the "back to home button" works - PERFECT)

contract-generator.html -> location of all the contracts on a drop-down, all tempates for the contracts connected, 
    show a preview of the contracts, live writing update on the contract, etc 

# run the code 
python3 -m http.server 8000
or
python -m http.server


# missing
- SO THIS IS THE BEST VERSION I HAVE SO FAR ---- BUT I STILL WANT TO ISOLATE THE "SELECT CONTRACT TYPE WITH THE THINGS ABOUT REGION/COURT/LENGUAGE" AND ALSO I GUESS INCORPORATE THE ESIGNATURE??? IDK THAT WAS HARD AND THATS WHAT GOT US IN THIS MESS


# updates 
- change the date so instead of #'s is the words 
- real state and mortgage (money in word and select if dollars or mexican)
- re-update the contract with the NEW templates (discord chat)
- theres some color inspo/idk 
- add the option of the contracts also being saved to the website and be viewable
