# Contract-Templates-
This is the three (3) templates that we have for the Owlery Management application for our Senior Project 


# whats been done
- created the template for the real estate contract (real_estate_contract.html) 
- created the template for the lease contract (lease_contract.html)
- created the template for the mortgage contract (mortgage_contract.html)
- made the index be in the right place so it launches directly with the created "Home Page"     
    that says the text "Welcome to Contract Generator
                Select a contract type and generate your legal document instantly.
                            Go to Contract Generator"


# pages 
index.html - this is the home page (so the "back to home button works)

contract-generator.html -> location of all the contracts, connects all the tempates for the contracts, 
    show a preview of the contracts, export to PDF 

# run the code 
python3 -m http.server 8000
or
python -m http.server
